# -Kernel-Smoothing-Technique-for-Option-Derivatives-
Options are an integral part of hedging strategies, portfolio management and many other facets of the finance industry. And Greeks of an option are used to assess different dimensions of risk involved in taking an options position. Each risk variable is a result of an imperfect assumption or relationship of the option with an underlying variable. Hence, calculation of Greeks is of utmost importance. In our report, we have implemented techniques called Kernel smoothing and Kernel differentiation, using Monte Carlo simulations, to calculate the following Greeks: Delta, Vega, Gamma, Vomma and Vanna, of a European Digital option.
